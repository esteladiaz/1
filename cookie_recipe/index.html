<h1>Task</h1>
<p>Your Grandma wants you to publish her famous cookie recipe to the world wide web, she's typed it out for you in this .html document (she's so nice).</p>

<p>She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The cookies won't taste good if you don't get the order right. (hint you need an ordered list).</p>

<p>Your Grandpa happens to be a great Graphic Designer and gave you the following specs to style:</p>

<h2>Cookie Recipe CSS</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The background color for the page is #FFE</li>
	<li>The color for the text reading "Nutrition Information" is #887</li>
	<li>The link color is #900</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus: The border on the page and around the image is black.</p>
